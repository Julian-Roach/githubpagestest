	<h1> A thought that inspired me to eat </h1>
	<p> There are many burgers in the world, but is there anything, anything
		at all which is better than a cheeseburger? A hamburger? I'd say no:
		many argue that hamburgers are better: however, aren't cheeseburgers,
		like, just hamburgers after all? Don't tell me you eat cheeseburgers
		with nothing but cheese!
	</p>
	<p>
		If cheeseburger is a hamburger with cheese, and cheese is a positive thing,
		then it necessarily follows that: 0 < cheese => hamburger < hamburger + cheese
		=> hamburger < cheeseburger. Therefore, I come to the conclusion, that the best
		burger is a cheeseburger.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is as clear as the sky that we must not only take the cheeseburger and the
		hamburger into consideration; they are not the only burgers that exist. Indeed,
		verily, a chickenburger is a powerful opponent of them both. With its meat being
		lighter, easier to eat, the sauces paired up with the chicken being sweeter, we might
		even begin to doubt our initial belief.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, purely morally speaking, I do not consider the chickenburger to be a real
		burger. It is nothing but a failed imitation of what a burger is supposed to be. A
		burger cannot be made of chicken, because the chicken doesn't belong amid lettuce,
		bread and tomatoes. It is extremely peculiar to me how popular chickenburgers are among
		people nowadays. Truly the corruptors of the youth. For these reasons, I do not consider
		the chickenburger to be a real burger, and therefore, I do not consider it to be a
		comparable opponent to the classic cheeseburger.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may not have taken into consideration all burger types yet. There exist many other
		burgers which might claim to be superior to our protagonist. However, empirically speaking,
		it seems to me that no antagonist can successfully match the power of the cheeseburger,
		for which reason I shall declare: the cheeseburger is the best burger in the world.

		Thank you for reading this article, and I hope you found it practical in your everyday
		life. :D
